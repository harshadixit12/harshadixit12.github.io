Hello!
I'm Harsha, I like learning new things and solving problems using what I learnt.
I have a background in Mathematics and Electronics Engineering, but found myself interested in networks, data structures and algorithms. I have been building software since.

I like to take notes when I am learning something new. Summarising it helps me understand better, which is what I'll be doing in this blog. While the blog is mostly about software, I will occasionally talk about finance and investing.
