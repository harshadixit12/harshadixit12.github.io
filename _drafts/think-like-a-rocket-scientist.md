Why I picked it up?
To get better at solving open ended engineering problems.

We as humans have a tendency to control everything we can. We are taught that there is a single right answer to every problem, and that science makes progress in a straight line.
The most scary scenario is when we have uncertainty without any bounds on it.
However, in real world, progress happens only when we grapple with uncertainty. We create value by making the most of uncertainty.
We can manage uncertainty through knowledge - by figuring out what we know and what we dont know, we can measure the uncertainty. Once we know what we don't know, we can manage it using engineering principles - redundancy and margins of safety.

Some good questions to ask - 
What am I afraid of?
What is the worst case scenario and how likely is it?
What is the best case scenario and how likely is it?
If probability of failure is high, what is the cose of failure? Is it one way door or two way door?
